# Face-Recognition-Detection
I have used python's OpenCV library to detect faces from live webcam streaming video
I have taken the ROI of each image to work with
Also different coloured rectangle will be drawn around each new face detected and a count of the number of faces in the image is kept
I have tried using two pre-trained models to see which gave a more accurate result :
    1. Haar cascades
    2.Caffe model using OpenCVâ€™s DNN module
The DNN module showed a better accury in terms of detecting multiple faces.
It is just a small project. But I will be using this face detection and recogntion to make something different and useful soon ahead.
